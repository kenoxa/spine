Review changed code against requested outcome and accepted plan. Structured, severity-bucketed findings. Read-only — no file writes, no test execution.

## Workflow

1. **Scope check** — confirm what was requested and what changed.
2. **Evidence check** — validate claims against current code and requirements.
3. **Spec compliance** — verify built behavior matches requested behavior.
4. **Risk pass** — correctness, security, performance, maintainability (scale by risk level).
5. **Quality pass** — readability, cohesion, duplication, test adequacy, edge/failure coverage.
6. **Output** — return findings using severity buckets below.

## Severity Buckets

| Bucket | Gate behavior |
|--------|--------------|
| `blocking` | Must fix before completion. Requires E2+ evidence. |
| `should_fix` | Recommended fix. Blocks completion unless user explicitly defers. |
| `follow_up` | Tracked debt. Does not block completion — record for future action. |

`blocking` findings without code evidence (E2+) are invalid — demote to `should_fix`.

## Risk Scaling

| Risk | Lenses |
|------|--------|
| Low | Spec compliance + quality |
| Medium | + testing-depth |
| High | + security probe |

### High-Risk Security Probe

When risk is high, explicitly check:
- Auth boundary regressions and privilege escalation paths
- Input trust boundaries (injection, unsafe parsing, unvalidated external data)
- Secret/token exposure in logs, configs, or error surfaces
- Failure-mode behavior that leaks data or bypasses controls

See also: [references/security-probe.md](references/security-probe.md) (false-positive filtering), `security-reviewer` (deeper heuristics), `visual-explainer` (diff explanations), `reducing-entropy` (net-complexity measurement).

## Noise Filtering

Before raising any finding, verify:
- Introduced or worsened by reviewed change — pre-existing issues out of scope
- Discrete and actionable — not general codebase observations
- Does not demand rigor absent from rest of codebase
- Security findings at high risk: apply exclusion rules from [references/security-probe.md](references/security-probe.md)

## Output Format

Per finding: severity bucket, target file(s), remediation path, evidence level.

Directional findings: numbered issue ID with options (A/B/C), recommendation first, include "do nothing" when reasonable. Tradeoff rationale per option.

## Bug-Fix Review

Require root-cause evidence — fix must target source trigger, not symptom. Missing root-cause → `blocking`.

## Documentation Review

When reviewing docs, READMEs, or user-facing text:
- Wording precision and actionability
- Outdated or contradictory statements
- Command/skill/API names match current surface
- Claims backed by codebase evidence — unsupported → `should_fix`

## Deferral Policy

- Any finding deferrable with explicit user approval. Deferred findings remain visible — never silently removed.
- Deferral is an exception path, not the default.

## Completion Declaration

When all resolved or deferred: `Review complete. No unresolved findings.` or `Review complete. Unresolved findings remain` + list.

## Evidence Levels

See AGENTS.md for E0–E3 definitions.

## Anti-Patterns

- Reviewing against personal preference instead of requested outcome and plan
- Blocking on E0-only claims without code evidence
- Writing files or executing tests during review
- Silently dropping deferred findings from output
- Skipping security probe on high-risk changes
- Merging review with implementation unless user asked for immediate fixes
